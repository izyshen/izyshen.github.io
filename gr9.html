			<p>Inspiration: Replication of an online image</p>
			<p>Medium: Oil pastel</p>
			<p>Notes from the artist: This was made for my grade 9 art class. We went on a trip to the zoo to inspire us about the intricacies and detailing of various animals: the scales on a fish, the nice curvature of a tucan's beak and of course the beautiful feathers on a bird. I think it's obvious what I was inspired by. This may not be a real animal but nonetheless it's probably one of my favourites.
