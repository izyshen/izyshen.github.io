			<p>Title: "Pinball Party"</p>
			<p>Medium: clay, pencil crayon, construction paper, wood, paint</p>
			<p>Inspiration: Charles Bell - an incredible still life painter with extreme care for details and bright colours. </p> 
			<p>Notes from the Artist: 
			The background of the board contains facts about Charles Bell. 
			I always tried to add a little more in my art pieces in school. The addition of wood was unique amongst my classmates; they stuck to using only the clay with which we were assigned to create something. Believe me when I say I was extremely excited to see this design come to life!</p>

			<p>Title: ""</p>
			<p>Medium: pencil crayons, oil pastel, charcoal</p>
			<p>Inspiration: The impending evil that seems to come with life </p> 
			<p>Notes from the Artist: It's peculiar how joyful and openminded children are when they are young but as we grow, we seem to lose that. That's what this drawing aims to capture: the brightness and optimism of children being corrupted. I don't mean this to be pessimistic but it is how life seems to be. That's why we should all tap into our inner child and see the world from their point of view from time to time.	</p>
