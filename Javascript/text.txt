The addition of wood was unique amonst my classmates; they stuck to using only clay. Believe me when I say I was extremely excited to see this design come to life. "

		"notes" : "It's peculiar how joyful and openminded children are when they are young but as we grow, we seem to lose that. That's what this drawing aims to capture: the brightness and optimism of children being corrupted. I don't mean this to be pessimistic but it is how life seems to be. That's why we should all tap into our inner child and see the world from their point of view from time to time."
